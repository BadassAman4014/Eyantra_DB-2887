# Eyantra_DB-2887

### Theme Introduction:
In this theme, the team will develop a Self-Balancing Bike, which will deliver various items throughout the cityscape. The delivery order will be decided by the priority of the package, thus posing a challenge in path planning. While development, you will learn the basics of the Control System and LQR controller design. The main challenges faced in this theme will be:

- Balancing of 2-wheeled Delivery Bike.
- Autonomous Navigation of Delivery Bike.
- Pickup and delivery in the arena.
